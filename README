This repository contains a number of government cables purportedly leaked by WikiLeaks. I found them on the Internet here:

    http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/series/us-embassy-cables-the-documents/

and copied them into this repository. Each cable document contains a URL pointing to the place it was copied from.

The purpose of this of this repository is to have a large collection of public data to use for developing data browsing software.
