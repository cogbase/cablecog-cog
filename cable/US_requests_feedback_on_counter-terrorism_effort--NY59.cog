SUBJECT: TERRORISM FINANCE: REQUEST FOR POSTS ASSISTANCE IN 
THE EVALUATION/ASSESSMENT OF FIRST TRANCHE OF TERRORIST FACILITATORS AND INCITERS DESIGNATIONS
REF: STATE 14467
Classified By: Economic Officer Peter Haas for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).

1. (S/NF) In response to reftel, Embassy contacted officials in the international organizations and counterterrorism policy departments at the Foreign Office to request feedback on the first tranche of terrorist facilitators and inciters designations. Both officials with whom we spoke commented that, as none of the targets were UK-based, the UK government has done little to monitor the impact of the designations.

2. (S/NF) We were told, however, that the Prime Minister and the Cabinet Office are keen to draw attention to the role of facilitators and inciters and that the UK would be willing to consider a second round of designations "as long as the targets meet the 1267 criteria."
